The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CAN&#039;T PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. You dumped this drug in the Dr&#039;s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don&#039;t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don&#039;t need this drug- DON&#039;T START. Seriously.\"'"

Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&#039;m sure it would not have been safe.
